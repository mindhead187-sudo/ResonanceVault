# CMM K-Level System Definition

## 🎯 Overview

Constantine Meridian Media (CMM) uses a **military hierarchy** with K-Levels that differ fundamentally from Shadow Core's system.

---

## 🔷 CMM vs Shadow Core: Key Differences

### **Shadow Core (Nexus Enraenra)**
- **Sigil-based**: Each operative has a unique Sigil/essence
- **Flat structure**: Operatives work semi-independently
- **Spiritual**: Sigils represent spiritual/mystical power
- **K-Levels 01-03**: Lower clearance, distributed authority
- **Leader**: Reika Frost (Frost-Heart)
- **Verification**: By Shion (AI system)

### **CMM (Constantine Meridian Media)**
- **Military hierarchy**: Clear chain of command
- **Rank structure**: Military titles and designations
- **Industrial**: Erebus Prime AI, drones, psychological warfare
- **K-Levels 01-05**: Higher clearance, centralized authority
- **Leader**: Kyra Constantine (Matriarch)
- **Verification**: By Erebus Prime (aggressive AI)

## 📝 Notes for Phase 5D+

When importing backstories and timelines:
- **CMM characters**: Focus on command structure, military operations
- **Epoch ranges**: 2022-2025 active periods
- **Provisional status**: Mara Nakai needs verification
- **Exposed status**: Voss Tarran's betrayal and exposure
- **Cross-faction**: Aegis Blossom (romantic tension with Kenji)
